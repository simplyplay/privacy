Simply Play uses Google Analytics or Google Firebase to help analyse user behaviour in the game. We mainly look out for how long users have spent in the game and how many levels were played.

Advertisements
Free Games & Apps
We display advertisements in our free apps and games to fund the development process for current and future services. The advertisements are provided by third party companies and if the user consented to personalised ads then your advertising identifier will be shared with the ad provider to select ads relevant to you. In some cases non-precise geolocation may be shared identifying the country or city you are located in.

Our apps may contain advertising from any of these networks:
Google (AdMob) privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
MoPub privacy policy: https://www.mopub.com/legal/privacy/
AdColony privacy policy: https://www.adcolony.com/privacy-policy/

Personalised Ads
Simply Play includes a GDPR ad personalisation opt in screen which appears upon launch if the user has not yet opted into personalisation. This screen explains ad personalisation, the ad providers being used in the game and allows the user to either opt-in enabling personalised ads or to not use personalisation.

Upon opting into personalisation, advertisers are permitted access to the advertising identifier on the device, no personal identifiable information linked with the user is used.


Paid Games & Apps
Our paid apps and games do not contain third party advertisements and thus no data is collected by third parties.


In-house Advertisements
In some apps and games we display internal advertisements in which we advertise other google play games which we feel players will be interested in; in order to provide the best scope of advertisements we use data listing which of your games you already have installed on your device. No user specific or app specific information is stored or recorded.
Advertisement Caching
We cache images used for internal advertisements by storing them in the application root directory allowing us to re-display advertisements without needing to download them again keeping data usage to a minimum.
In-app Products
General
Some of our apps include paid items which can be purchased for additional content. These apps are labelled as containing in-app purchases on the storefront prior to purchase.

Paid items are clearly labelled as a paid item displaying price in your local currency prior to accepting and making the purchase.

Parents can also apply parental filters which require approval before these items can be purchased or simply block in-app purchasing completely.
We may or may not offer refunds based on a case by case basis. However, refunds are generally deemed to be mostly attributed to buyers remorse and cause us a great loss as company. 

Auto-Renewing Subscriptions
These subscriptions will automatically charge you until manually cancelled. Visit the subscription management section of your app store to cancel an active subscription.

Non-Renewing Subscriptions
These are subscriptions which need to be manually paid per billing cycle. When left unpaid the subscription will be cancelled at the end of the billing period and any rewards for continuous subscription periods may be lost.
Children
Our applications are intended for a general audience of all ages; however prior to app download our apps have an age rating assigned.

In some cases our apps may be enlisted into the Google Play family program which means the app does not collect any personal information and has been certified by Google as safe for children.

The majority of our apps do not collect personal information but in cases where we do, we ask the user to agree to our terms of service and agree that they're at least 13 years of age or ask that a parent consents for them. We do not knowingly collect or track personal information from users under 13 years old without prior parental consent. If informed of any personal information collected from users below this age without consent then we will delete the information and stop any further collection from the individual (account removal).

If you are a parent or guardian and are worried that we may have collected any personal information about your child unknowingly please email us and we will delete any information from our system.
